<h4><strong>
    My Hobby:
</strong></h4>
<p> The hobby I like most is watching TV. When I have free time, I love to watch Television. 
    It never interferes with my study. First of all, I like to finish my school home task and then start watching TV.
    I think it’s a good habit because watching TV brings a lot of knowledge in any field.
    I watch the news and other channels such as discovery channel, animal planet or another informative channel. 
    Sometimes, I watch very good cartoons that provide me creative and new ideas to make cartoons and arts.
    I develop my hobby since my childhood. Watching television in a proper way gives so important roles in one’s life. 
    It helps us to make something creative. It always keeps us an update about all kinds of news and views.
    It informs us what’s happening across the world.
    Getting knowledge about today’s incident is so important for modern society due to a great level of competition. 
    It gives a lot of benefits as it develops our knowledge and thoughts. It enriches our mind of thoughts, ideas, and experiences.
    There are different types of programs on TV that are so crucial to enhance our awareness about worldwide matters. 
    TV channels also hold different types of educative programs such as history, economics, science, math, culture, 
    and geography etc. to develop our knowledge.</p>
