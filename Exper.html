    <h1>Experience as a Student</h1>
<h6>The college experience is my initial step into finding my future career. 
    Leaving home for the first time in my life and finding out if I have the skills to make it in the real world. 
    Continuing my education in hopes of finding a great career and making lots of money for a leisurely lifestyle.
     Leaving my home and city for the first time and opening a new chapter in life. 
     Not seeing people that I’m used to seeing everyday and adjusting to a different kind of lifestyle. 
     It is a make it or break it moment in life.
    Adjusting to life on campus wasn’t difficult because there are no more of those parent rules anymore, 
    Freedom to make all of my own choices without having to consult anyone anymore. 
    Now I have the freedom to decide to do whatever I want at any time of my choosing.<strong>
